          <h3 class=paragraph_titles>Gingerbread House</h3>
            <p>A gingerbread house is a model house or similar structure made of gingerbread. The usual material is crisp ginger biscuit made of gingerbread – the ginger nut. Another type of model-making with gingerbread uses a boiled dough that can be moulded like clay to form edible statuettes or other decorations. These houses, covered with a variety of candies and icing, are popular Christmas decorations, often built by children with the help of their parents. Records of honey cakes can be traced to ancient Rome.[2] Food historians ratify that ginger has been seasoning foodstuffs and drinks since antiquity. It is believed gingerbread was first baked in Europe at the end of the 11th century, when returning crusaders brought back the custom of spicy bread from the Middle East.[3] Ginger was not only tasty, it had properties that helped preserve the bread. According to the French legend, gingerbread was brought to Europe in 992 by the Armenian monk, later saint, Gregory of Nicopolis (Gregory Makar). He lived for seven years in Bondaroy, France, near the town of Pithiviers, where he taught gingerbread cooking to priests and other Christians. He died in 999.[4][5][6] Gingerbread, as we know it today, descends from Medieval European culinary traditions. Gingerbread was also shaped into different forms by monks in Franconia, Germany in the 13th century. Lebkuchen bakers are recorded as early as 1296 in Ulm and 1395 in Nuremberg, Germany. Nuremberg was recognized as the "Gingerbread Capital of the World" when in the 1600s the guild started to employ master bakers and skilled workers to create complicated works of art from gingerbread.[3] Medieval bakers used carved boards to create elaborate designs. During the 13th century, the custom spread across Europe. It was taken to Sweden in the 13th century by German immigrants; there are references from Vadstena Abbey of Swedish nuns baking gingerbread to ease indigestion in 1444.[7][8] The traditional sweetener is honey, used by the guild in Nuremberg. Spices used are ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and cardamom. Gingerbread figurines date back to the 15th century, and figural biscuit-making was practised in the 16th century.[9] The first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread biscuits is from the court of Elizabeth I of England: she had gingerbread figures made in the likeness of some of her important guests.[10]</p>

            <h3 class=paragraph_titles>Christmas Ham</h3>
            <p>A Christmas ham or Yule ham is a traditional dish associated with modern Christmas and historical Yule. The tradition is believed to have begun among the Germanic peoples as a tribute to Freyr, a god in Germanic paganism associated with boars (see Sonargöltr), harvest and fertility.[1] According to some folklorists and historians[2] the Christmas ham's origins in England lay in a: "tradition [that] was initiated in all probability on the Isle of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons, although our knowledge of it comes substantially from medieval times....[In ancient Norse tradition] sacrifice carried the intent of imploring Freyr to show favor to the new year. The boar's head with apple in mouth was carried into the banquet hall on a gold or silver dish to the sounds of trumpets and the songs of minstrels."[3]In Scandinavia and England, Saint Stephen may have inherited some of Freyr's legacy. His feast day is 26 December and thus he came to play a part in the Yuletide celebrations which were previously associated with Freyr. In old Swedish art, Stephen is shown as tending to horses and bringing a boar's head to a Yuletide banquet.[4] Both elements are extra-canonical and may be pagan survivals. The Christmas ham (Yule ham), is often associated with modern Christmas. This tradition is suggested to have begun among the Germans as a tribute to Freyr, the god of Germanic paganism who is associated with boars, harvest, and fertility[5].Swedes celebrate Christmas in many different ways, and many of the local customs and specialties still survive. A small selection of classic dishes for a Swedish Christmas meal (julbord) include: Christmas ham (which is first boiled; then painted and glazed with a mixture of egg, breadcrumbs, and mustard); and then baked, pork sausage, an egg and anchovy mixture (gubbröra), herring salad, pickled herring, home-made liver pâté, wort-flavoured rye bread (vörtbröd), potatoes, and a special fish dish.[6]) Ham is a traditional Australian dish that features on most tables on Christmas Day. It is cooked and served in many ways all around the Australia, with many families adding their own secrets to the ham, making it a special aspect of a Christmas lunch or dinner.[8]'Christmas in Australia comes at the beginning of summer, and many people no longer serve a traditional hot roast dinner. Cold turkey and ham, seafood, and salads are often served instead.[9][10]</p>

            <h3 class=paragraph_titles>Chinese Hot Pot</h3>
            <p>Hot pot (also known as steamboat in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, China, Taiwan, and Brunei) refers to several East Asian varieties of stew, consisting of a simmering metal pot of stock at the center of the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leaf vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, egg dumplings, tofu, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce. Hot pot meals are usually eaten in the winter during supper time. The Chinese hot pot has a history of more than 1,000 years.[1] Hot pot seems to have originated in Mongolia and the Jin Dynasty where the main ingredient was meat, usually beef, mutton or horse. It then spread to southern China during the Song Dynasty and was further established during the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty.[1] In time, regional variations developed with different ingredients such as seafood. By the Qing Dynasty (AD 1644 to 1912), the hot pot became popular throughout most of China. Today in many modern homes, particularly in larger cities, the traditional coal-heated steamboat or hot pot has been replaced by electric, propane, butane gas, or induction cooker versions. Different kinds of hot pots can be found in Beijing – typically, more modern eateries offer the sectioned bowl with differently flavored broths in each section. More traditional or older establishments serve a fragrant, mild broth in the hot pot, which is a large brass vessel heated by burning coals in a central chimney. The broth is boiled in a deep, donut-shaped bowl surrounding the chimney. Taiwanese hot pot usually is called 火鍋 in Mandarin or Taiwanese, but is also called shabu-shabu when the hotpot is Japanese style hotpot, ie. shabu-shabu, due to Japanese influence.[citation needed] It is very common to eat the food with a dipping sauce consisting of shacha sauce and raw egg yolk.</p>
